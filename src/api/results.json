[{"title":"A Song of Ice and Fire","author":"George R. R. Martin","description":"A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin. He began the first volume of the series, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, and it was published in 1996 \n A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine in the first novel, to 31 characters by the fifth novel. Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in northernmost Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne. \n Martin's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon. A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion, as well as its realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point-of-view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise. \n ","cover":"http://manjiltamang.vortexnepal.com/assets/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_book_collection_box_set_cover.jpg","Addeddate":"2019-05-06 23:29:45","Boxid":"OL100020MMM","Identifier":"ASongOfIceAndFire5ADanceWithDragons","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"200:38:15","Source":"-","Tapedby":"-","Year":"-","audios":[{"title":"A Song of Ice and Fire 1 - A Game of Thrones","source":"https://ia803009.us.archive.org/15/items/ASongOfIceAndFire5ADanceWithDragons/A%20Song%20of%20Ice%20and%20Fire%201%20-%20A%20Game%20of%20Thrones.mp3"},{"title":"A Song of Ice and Fire 2 - A Clash of Kings","source":"https://ia803009.us.archive.org/15/items/ASongOfIceAndFire5ADanceWithDragons/A%20Song%20of%20Ice%20and%20Fire%202%20-%20A%20Clash%20of%20Kings.mp3"},{"title":"A Song of Ice and Fire 3 - A Storme of Swords","source":"https://ia803009.us.archive.org/15/items/ASongOfIceAndFire5ADanceWithDragons/A%20Song%20of%20Ice%20and%20Fire%203%20-%20A%20Storm%20of%20Swords.mp3"},{"title":"A Song of Ice and Fire 4 - A Feasts for Crows","source":"https://ia803009.us.archive.org/15/items/ASongOfIceAndFire5ADanceWithDragons/A%20Song%20of%20Ice%20and%20Fire%204%20-%20A%20Feast%20For%20Crows.mp3"},{"title":"A Song of Ice and Fire 5 - A Dance with Dragons","source":"https://ia803009.us.archive.org/15/items/ASongOfIceAndFire5ADanceWithDragons/A%20Song%20of%20Ice%20and%20Fire%205%20-%20A%20Dance%20with%20Dragons.mp3"}]},{"title":"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Version 2)","author":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle","description":"LibriVox recording of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Read by Ruth Golding.A collection of twelve short stories featuring Conan Doyle's legendary detective, originally published as single stories in Strand Magazine and subsequently collected into a single volume.There is not always a crime committed nor a culprit to find, and when there is, Holmes does not invariably get his man. However, his extraordinary powers of deduction generally solve the mystery, often to the discomfiture of the official police force. Holmes is a man of many facets, and I do not share the common perception of Holmes as cold and humourless: his sense of fun can be sparkling, and there are moments of rare pathos.

Published in 1854, it details Thoreau’s life for two years, two months, and two days around the shores of Walden Pond. Walden is neither a novel nor a true autobiography, but a social critique of the Western World, with each chapter heralding some aspect of humanity that needed to be either renounced or praised. Along with his critique of the civilized world, Thoreau examines other issues afflicting man in society, ranging from economy and reading to solitude and higher laws. He also takes time to talk about the experience at Walden Pond itself, commenting on the animals and the way people treated him for living there, using those experiences to bring out his philosophical positions. This extended commentary on nature has often been interpreted as a strong statement to the natural religion that transcendentalists like Thoreau and Emerson were preaching.

Read by Denny Sayers.Daniel Defoe's The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner (1719) is considered by many the first English novel. Based on the real-life experiences of the castaway Alexander Selkirk, the book has had a perrenial appeal among readers of all ages - especially the young adult reading public - who continue to find inspiration in the inventive resourcefulness of its hero, sole survivor of a shipwreck who is marooned on an uninhabited island.Especially poignant, after more than two decades of unbroken solitude, is the affection that Robinson develops for Friday, another survivor fleeing certain death at the hands of enemy tribesmen from the South American continent.

The poem is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, and concerns the events that befall the Greek hero Odysseus in his long journey back to his native land Ithaca after the fall of Troy.It takes Odysseus ten years to return to his native land of Ithaca after ten years of war; during his 20-year absence, his son Telemachus and his wife Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors who have moved into Odysseus’ home to compete for Penelope’s hand in marriage, since most have assumed that Odysseus has died.The poem is a fundamental text in the Western canon and continues to be read in both Homeric Greek and translations around the world.(Summary from Wikipedia)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (167MB)Download M4B Part 2 (161MB)Oct 26, 2012 - Normalized volumes on files to fix large volume discrepancies.\n","cover":"https://ia802307.us.archive.org/30/items/odyssey_butler_librivox/The_Odyssey_1005.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-03-12 10:28:07","Boxid":"OL100020216","Identifier":"odyssey_butler_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"11:18:25","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 01","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_01_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 02","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_02_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 03","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_03_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 04","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_04_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 05","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_05_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 06","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_06_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 07","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_07_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 08","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_08_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 09","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_09_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 10","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_10_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 11","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_11_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 12","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_12_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 13","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_13_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 14","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_14_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 15","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_15_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 16","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_16_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 17","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_17_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 18","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_18_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 19","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_19_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 20","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_20_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 21","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_21_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 22","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_22_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 23","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_23_homer_butler.mp3"},{"title":"The Odyssey: Book 24","source":"https://archive.org/download/odyssey_butler_librivox/odyssey_24_homer_butler.mp3"}]},{"title":"Anne of Green Gables","author":"Lucy Maud Montgomery","description":"Librivox recording of Anne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery.Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic children's novel, Anne of Green Gables tells the story of a red headed orphan girl with a personality you can't help but love.

Translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.    The Divine Comedy (Italian: Commedia, later christened “Divina” by Giovanni Boccaccio), written by Dante Alighieri between 1308 and his death in 1321, is widely considered the central epic poem of Italian literature, the last great work of literature of the Middle Ages and the first great work of the Renaissance. A culmination of the medieval world-view of the afterlife, it establishes the Tuscan dialect in which it is written as the Italian standard, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature.The Divine Comedy is composed of three canticas (or “cantiche”) — Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise) — composed each of 33 cantos (or “canti”). The very first canto serves as an introduction to the poem and is generally not considered to be part of the first cantica, bringing the total number of cantos to 100.The poet tells in the first person his travel through the three realms of the dead, lasting during the Easter Triduum in the spring of 1300.For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audio books or to become a volunteer reader, visit LibriVox.org.

The novel is nominally about the obsessive hunt by the crazed Captain Ahab of the book's eponymous white whale. But interspersed in that story are digressions, paradoxes, philosophical riffs on whaling and life, and a display of techniques so advanced for its time that some have referred to the 1851 Moby Dick as the first \"modern\" novel.

The story begins as the Invisible Man, with a bandaged face and a heavy coat and gloves, takes a train to lodge in a country inn whilst he tries to discover the antidote and make himself visible again. The book inspired several films and is notable for its vivid descriptions of the invisible man--no mean feat, given that you can't see him!

Read by Mark F. Smith.In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain creates an entertaining adventure of Middle America in the 1800's - afloat on a raft on the Mississippi River. Huck escapes his civilized life when he arranges his own \"murder\" and turns back into the backwoods, downriver yokel he started as, and in the process springing a slave, Jim, from bondage.Huck and Jim experience life as a series of tableaus as the river sweeps them through small towns on their way South. At each stop, Huck engages his talent for mixing fact with bald-faced lies to endlessly get himself out of situations... and of course, putting him into others!Much has been written about the statement Twain is making about slavery in this book, but it's really secondary to the story. The facts of how black people were treated in this period give Huck and Jim their license for life on the run. Modern listeners will be intrigued by the unencumbered life of the pair; they make do with coffee, fish from the river, and little else (but of course, when they do need something extra, they don't mind helping themselves to it without recourse to money!)Huck and Jim have run-ins with desperados and family feuds and even manage to get run down by a steamboat. The adventures ratchet up when they are joined on the raft by a self-proclaimed \"duke\" and a \"king\" - shysters both, who spend their time in figuring how to fleece the public in the little river towns. And when Jim is captured and threatened with being sent back into slavery, Huck enlists his old buddy Tom Sawyer in a frenzied, desperate, and terribly funny rescue.I had to clip a lot of laughing from this recording at Twain's sly, catch-'em-when-they're-not-looking humor, but you can feel free to enjoy some good belly laughs at this crew of lovable rapscallions!

It is considered a classic of children's literature and has spawned many derivative works of art, such as Disney's classic 1940 animated movie of the same name, and commonplace ideas, such as a liar's long nose.(Summary from Wikipedia)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats or languages (if available), please go to the

Expectations, read by Mark F. Smith. This classic tale tells of an orphan, Pip, who through a series of strange circumstances first finds a trade as a blacksmith's apprentice and then learns that he has \"great expectations\" of a future inheritance from an anonymous benefactor. He soon learns to live the profligate life of a gentleman as he gradually sheds his associations with the gentle souls of his past, Joe (the blacksmith) and Biddy (a level-headed young lady). He throws his money at improving the prospects of his roommate and friend Herbert and his heart at an \"ice princess\" whose heart will never respond. But then an escaped convict from his distant past comes calling, and all Pip's hopes dissolve. (Summary by Mark F.

Take a family with five unmarried daughters and a lack of wealth, throw in a new wealthy neighbor or two, plus a whole regiment of soldiers in town, and add a heaping spoonful of pride and a pinch of prejudice. Mix it all together and you get a story full of tears and laughter, embarrassment and pride, and, of course, love.

It is considered to be one of the most characteristic examples of the \"literary nonsense\" genre, and its narrative course and structure have been enormously influential, especially in the fantasy genre.

Smith.    The Swiss Family Robinson has delighted generations of readers with its exciting tale of a family which, though shipwrecked, displays “the right stuff” and builds a charming colony that later, they do not want to leave. Cut off from the comforts and companionship of other humans, they use a familiarity with natural history and biology to find the resources and build the tools to construct a canoe, weave cloth, irrigate a garden, and turn an immense hollow tree into a lofty house with a spiral staircase. They domesticate buffaloes, wild asses, and monkeys. They establish farms and plantations. And finally, they have a terrifying encounter with natives from a nearby island.    Johann David Wyss, the author, did not live to complete his tale. Storytellers over the years have injected so many episodes into the various versions that probably none closely match the original. (Indeed, the Baroness de Montholieu expanded the book from two volumes into five when she translated it into French.) This effort was re-translated into English in 1849 by W.H.G. Kingston, abridging the edition severely. It follows the British sensibilities of the period in terms of sentence structure and emphasis. (Summary by Mark F.

Read by Elizabeth Klett.Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's classic comic romance, in which the five Bennett sisters try to find that most elusive creature: a single man in possession of a large fortune.  Sparks fly when sweet, pretty Jane meets their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley, but her sister Elizabeth is most offended by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy.  This is Austen at the height of her powers: the ironic narration, hilariously drawn supporting characters, and romantic suspense make this her most enduringly popular novel.

It is widely held to be one of Dickens’ finest and most complete novels, containing one of the most vast, complex and engaging arrays of minor characters and sub-plots in his entire canon. Dickens tells all of these both through the narrative of the novel’s heroine, Esther Summerson, and as an omniscient narrator. Memorable characters include the menacing lawyer Tulkinghorn, the friendly but depressive John Jarndyce and the childish Harold Skimpole. The plot concerns a long-running legal dispute (Jarndyce and Jarndyce) which has far-reaching consequences for all involved.(Summary from Wikipedia)For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org.Download M4B part 1 (228MB)Download M4B part 2 (208MB)Download M4B part 3 (233MB)Download M4B part 4 (182MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800709.us.archive.org/13/items/bleak_house_cl_librivox/Bleak_House_1003.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2008-01-23 05:04:58","Boxid":"OL100020109","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-27T05:32:31Z","Identifier":"bleak_house_cl_librivox","Runtime":"43:30:19","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2008          ","audios":[{"title":"01 -

Stowe was a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active abolitionist. The novel is believed to have had a profound effect on the North’s view of slavery. In fact, when he met Harriet Beecher Stowe, President Lincoln is said to have commented, \"So you're the little lady whose book started the Civil War.\" First published on March 20, 1852, the story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave, the central character around whose life the other characters—both fellow slaves and slave owners—revolve. The novel depicts the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that Christian love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings. (Summary by Wikipedia and John Greenman)Note From the Reader: The listener is about to enter a world rich with diverse characters. In order to differentiate between the characters, the reader has given each, his/her own voice. As an adult male reader, however, the reader’s representation of women and children will, necessarily be less than adequate. He asks for your indulgence.

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain. Read by Annie Coleman. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) by Mark Twain is one of the truly great American novels, beloved by children, adults, and literary critics alike. The book tells the story of \"Huck\" Finn (first introduced as Tom Sawyer's sidekick in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer), his friend Jim, and their journey down the Mississippi River on a raft. Both are on the run, Huck from his drunk and abusive father, and Jim as a runaway slave.As Huck and Jim drift down the river, they meet many colorful characters and have many great adventures. The true heart of the story, however, is the friendship between Huck and Jim. A constant theme throughout the book is Huck's internal struggle between what he has been taught, that helping a runaway slave is a sin, and what he truly believes, that Jim is a good man and it couldn't possibly be wrong to help him.Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was unique at the time of its publication (1884) because it is narrated by Huck himself and is written in the numerous dialects common in the area and time in which the book is set. Although the book was originally intended as a sequel to the children's book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, as Twain wrote Adventures of Huckleberry Finn it progressed into a more serious work. Twain's views on slavery and other social issues of the time become clear through the words, thoughts, and actions of Huck Finn. The book has always been the subject of great controversy, and according to The American Library Association it was fifth on the list of most frequently challenged books in the 1990s.(Summary by Annie Coleman) For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

It is often considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas's most popular work. The writing of the work was completed in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815–1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. It is primarily concerned with themes of justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness, and is told in the style of an adventure story.

Read by Karen Savage.Pride and Prejudice is the most famous of Jane Austen’s novels, and its opening is one of the most famous lines in English literature - “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” Its manuscript was first written between 1796 and 1797, and was initially called First Impressions, but was never published under that title. Following revisions it was published on 28 January 1813 by the same Mr. Egerton of the Military Library, Whitehall, who had brought out Sense and Sensibility. Like both its predecessor and Northanger Abbey, it was written at Steventon Rectory.

Read by Cori Samuel.Love and Freindship [sic] is a juvenile story by Jane Austen, dated 1790, when Austen was 14 years old. Love and Freindship (the misspelling is one of many in the story) is clearly a parody of romantic novels Austen read as a child. This is clear even from the subtitle, \"Deceived in Freindship and Betrayed in Love,\" which neatly undercuts the title.Written in epistolary form, it resembles a fairy tale as much as anything else, featuring wild coincidences and turns of fortune, but Austen is determined to lampoon the conventions of romantic stories, right down to the utter failure of romantic fainting spells, which always turn out dreadfully for the female characters.In this story one can see the development of Austen's sharp wit and disdain for romantic sensibility, so characteristic of her later novels.Summary revised from Wikipedia by Cori Samuel.

Read by Chere Theriot.Anthem is a dystopic science fiction story taking place at some unspecified future date. Mankind has entered another dark age as a result of what Rand saw as the weaknesses of socialistic thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully planned (when it is allowed to occur, if at all) and the concept of individuality has been eliminated (for example, the word \"I\" has disappeared from the language). As is common in her work, Rand draws a clear distinction between the \"socialist/communal\" values of equality and brotherhood and the \"productive/capitalist\" values of achievement and individuality. The story also parallels Stalinist Russia, which was currently going on at the time as the story was published.

Why settle down to some humdrum uncongenial billet, when excitement, romance, danger and a decent living were all going begging together?” - A. J. Raffles, The Ides of March.\n\nThe Amateur Cracksman is the first collection of stories about A. J. Raffles, gentleman, cricketer, and thief. After stopping his old school friend, Bunny Manders, from a desperate attempt at suicide, Raffles introduces the unsuspecting Bunny to a new way of earning a living, burglary. Though frequently horrified by Raffles's actions, the conscience-stricken Bunny stands by him through all their adventures, firm to his promise, “When you want me, I'm your man!” (Summary by Kristin Hughes)\n\nFor more information on our readers, please visit the catalog pageDownload M4B (147MB)\n","cover":"https://ia802701.us.archive.org/29/items/amateur_cracksman_librivox/Amateur_Cracksman_1004.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-10-20 19:00:50","Boxid":"OL100020204","External_metadata_update":"2019-04-09T14:40:41Z","Identifier":"amateur_cracksman_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"5:25:24","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"01 - The Ides of March","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_01_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"02 - A Costume Piece","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_02_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"03 - Gentlemen and Players","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_03_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"04 - Le Premier Pas","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_04_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"05 - Wilful Murder","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_05_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"06 - Nine Points of the Law","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_06_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"07 - The Return Match","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_07_hornung.mp3"},{"title":"08 - The Gift of the Emperor","source":"https://archive.org/download/amateur_cracksman_librivox/amateur_cracksman_08_hornung.mp3"}]},{"title":"How to Speak and Write Correctly","author":"Joseph Devlin","description":"LibriVox recording of How to Speak and Write Correctly, by Joseph Devlin.Read by Librivox volunteers.This is a 1910 guide for those who wish to learn how to correctly (though maybe not \"properly\") create sentences, use figures of speech, write letters, and more, all while choosing the right words and doing it with style.

In this popular American book from the 1920s, accomplished public speaker and self-help charlatan Elsie Lincoln Benedict outlines her pseudo-scientific system of \"Human Analysis\". She proposes that, within the human race, five sub-types have developed through evolutionary processes, each with its own distinct character traits and corresponding outward appearance. She offers to teach the reader how to recognise these five types of people and understand their innate differences. Her ideas have never been taken seriously by the scientific community, but this book is considered a classic within its genre and remains in print today.

Translated by Benjamin Jowett.Read by Kevin Johnson.As Jowett relates in his brilliant introduction, 95% of Plato's writing is certain and his reputation rests soundly on this foundation. The Alcibiades 1 appears to be a short work by Plato with only two characters: Socrates and Alcibiades. This dialogue has little dramatic verisimilitude but centres on the question of what knowledge one needs for political life. Like the early dialogues, the question is on whether the virtues needed by a statesman can be taught, on the importance of self-knowledge as a starting point for any leader. While this may be only partially the work of Plato, or even not his at all, Jowett favoured the work with his magisterial translation and appears to favour its inclusion in the canon of true works.

Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass exalted the body and the material world.Whitman was inspired to begin Leaves of Grass after reading an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson which expressed a need for a uniquely American poet.  When the book was first published, Whitman sent a copy to Emerson, whose praiseful letter of response helped launch the book to success.  Whitman's hero, Abraham Lincoln, read and enjoyed an early version of Leaves of Grass.  Despite such high recommendations, Whitman faced charges of obscenity and immorality for his work, but this only led to increased popularity of the book.Whitman continually revised and republished Leaves of Grass throughout his lifetime, notably adding the \"Drum-Taps\" section after Lincoln's assassination.  The book grew from 12 poems in its first publication, which Whitman paid for and typeset himself, to nearly 400 poems in its final, \"Death Bed Edition.\"  This recording is of the final edition.(Summary adapted from wikipedia.org by Annie Coleman)For more information on our readers, see our catalog page: http://librivox.org/leaves-of-grass-by-walt-whitman/For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.orgDownload M4B Part 1 (270MB)Download M4B Part 2 (196MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800901.us.archive.org/30/items/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_of_grass_itemimage.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-03-16 02:09:04","Boxid":"OL100020513","External_metadata_update":"2019-03-31T23:11:12Z","Identifier":"leaves_of_grass_librivox","Runtime":"19:16:02","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"Book 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_01_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_02_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 3, Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_03.1_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 3, Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_03.2_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 3, Part 3","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_03.3_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 3, Part 4","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_03.4_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 4","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_04_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 5","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_05_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 6-7","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_06-07_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 8-10","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_08-10_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 11-12","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_11-12_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 13","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_13_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 14","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_14_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 15","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_15_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 16","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_16_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 17","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_17_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 18","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_18_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 19","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_19_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 20","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_20_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 21, Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_21.1_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 21, Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_21.2_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 22","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_22_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 23","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_23_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 24, Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_24.1_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 24, Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_24.2_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 25","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_25_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 26","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_26_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 27-28","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_27-28_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Books 29-30","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_29-30_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 31","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_31_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 32","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_32_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 33","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_33_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 34","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_34_whitman.mp3"},{"title":"Book 35","source":"https://archive.org/download/leaves_of_grass_librivox/leaves_35_whitman.mp3"}]},{"title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (dramatic reading)","author":"Lewis Carroll","description":"LibriVox recording of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.

Read by JD.\n\nThe Gods of Mars is a 1918 Edgar Rice Burroughs science fiction novel, the second of his famous Barsoom series. It can be said that the novel set the tone for much science fiction to come. Its influence can clearly be seen in franchises such as Star Trek and Farscape. While Burroughs no doubt borrowed liberally from the pulp fiction of his day, particularly westerns and swashbuckling tales, the pacing and themes set the tone for the soft science fiction genre.The protagonist, John Carter, with his proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and flirtations with beautiful alien women, could be said to have set the mold for later influential icons like Captain James T. Kirk and James Bond.At the end of the first book, A Princess of Mars, John Carter is unwillingly transported back to Earth. The Gods of Mars begins with his arrival back on Barsoom (Mars) after a ten year hiatus, separated from his wife Dejah Thoris, his unborn child, and the Red Martian people of the nation of Helium, whom he has adopted as his own. Unfortunately, John Carter materializes in the one place on Barsoom from which nobody is allowed to depart: the Valley Dor, which is the Barsoomian heaven.

Read in English by Bob Gonzalez; ToddHW; CaprishaPage; Lucretia B.; Libby Gohn; Marie Hoffman Who was John Milton? The author of Paradise Lost you say? Well, certainly, but he was also a man, going about his daily life like any of us in 17th century England, (except that he was a genius of course). Take time to read about a day in his life and learn more about him and his likes, dislikes, background and proclivities. Also, the same with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Walt Witman, Lord Byron, Keats and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Each of them a man or woman of their times, living each day like us, but seeing shades and hues of life that we can only experience through their exquisite poetry. These are meant by the author to be brief biographies with examples of their works and some insights into their common foibles as humans in addition to human geniuses. If you love to read poetry, you will enjoy reading these short bios which contain much of their best poetry in them. The selections are from 6 stand alone sources but Browning is part of another book and the link below is to that directly.

When she sees a White Rabbit as it runs through the tall grass (looking worriedly at the watch it takes from its waist-coat pocket), she runs after it and drops into a strange dream. The world is full of chatty animals, from a rather stand-offish hookah-smoking caterpillar to the friendly Cheshire Cat which only sometimes goes to the bother of having a body. And everyone seems to be ordering her about ... or telling her to recite poetry! ... and all those verses that she once knew so well seem strangely distorted.  In this book and in \"Through the Looking Glass\", Lewis Carroll affectionately brought together many of the wonderful stories he told to Alice and her sisters on long summer boating trips.

Salió a la venta en enero de 1605 con numerosas erratas, a causa de la celeridad que imponía el contrato de edición. Esta edición se reimprimió en el mismo año y en el mismo taller, de forma que hay en realidad dos ediciones de 1605 ligeramente distintas. Se sospecha, sin embargo, que existió una novela más corta, que sería una de sus futuras Novelas ejemplares.

The most important of these was the unification and militarization of Germany. The story, written in a semi-documentary style, is told in the first person by an unnamed observer. It tells of the events which happen mostly in London and the county of Surrey, England, when a number of vessels manned by aliens are fired from Mars and land on Earth.

Read in English by a full cast. Growing up on the banks of the Mississippi river, a mischievous boy named Tom Sawyer spends his days getting into one scrape after another. Tom's constant cleverness, superstition, trickery, and daring make him a handful to raise, and his Aunt Polly declares that she has \"never seen the beat of that boy!\" Tom is essentially good-hearted, however, but when he is witness to a horrible crime, his courage and integrity are tested beyond anything he ever expected. A note to parents: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is considered a children's classic, but contains racial slurs which, although \"acceptable\" in the time and place of the story's setting, will likely offend modern listeners.

Read by Michael Sirois.This novel (original French title -- L'Île des Pingouins) is a satire on human nature. The first publication was in 1908. These penguins are mistaken for humans by the 97-year-old priest, Father Mael, because of his bad eyesight. He baptizes them, and once baptized, they have no choice but to become human. They take on human traits (build civilizations, go to war, etc.). The book is very funny and powerful.

Vonnegut, Jr.","description":"LibriVox recording of 2 B R 0 2 B & The Big Trip Up Yonder, by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Read by Phil ChenevertThese two stories by Kurt Vonnegut were written almost a decade apart but they are definitely connected. The Big Trip Up Yonder, published in Galaxy Science Fiction January 1954 is a comical yet scary description of what over population was going to do to society after aging was conquered and a simple daily dose of \"anti-gerosone\" would keep you forever the same age. Would Gramps EVER take 'That Big Trip Up Yonder', or would his hordes of descendants be stuck with him forever in a tiny apartment!? 2 B R 0 2 B, published in Worlds of If, January 1962 takes this basic situation many years into the future and a solution has been found. The population of the US has dropped from 40 billion to 40 million. Not what everyone would call a pretty solution, or perhaps the best solution, but nevertheless a solution to the population problem. I believe this is the type of story it is best to listen to, not describe, so enjoy.

Read by Ruth Golding.Emily Brontë's only novel, published in 1847 under the pseudonym Ellis Bell, tells the tale of the all-encompassing and passionate, yet thwarted, love between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and how this unresolved passion eventually destroys them and many around them.Now considered a classic of English literature, Wuthering Heights met with mixed reviews by critics when it first appeared, with many horrified by the stark depictions of mental and physical cruelty. Though Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre was originally considered the best of the Brontë sisters' works, many subsequent critics of Wuthering Heights argued that its originality and achievement made it superior.

Conrad based the work closely on his own terrible experience in the Congo.This work has been reinterpreted and adapted into many modern forms, the most well known being the film Apocalypse Now.(Summary written by Marlo Dianne)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit Librivox.orgDownload M4B (119MB)\n","cover":"https://ia800205.us.archive.org/2/items/heart_of_darkness/Heart_of_Darkness.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-03-11 18:19:41","Album":"Heart of Darkness","Artist":"Joseph Conrad","Boxid":"OL100020302","External-identifier":"\n              urn:mb_releasegroup_id:5f5ca70a-3aa2-425e-8810-65caec26cc53          \n              urn:mb_release_id:83d8520e-36de-4cd0-998b-f819f28bd00e          \n              urn:upc:          ","Identifier":"heart_of_darkness","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"4:10:12","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"Chapter 1 Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_1a_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 1 Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_1b_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 2 Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_2a_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 2 Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_2b_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 3 Part 1","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_3a_conrad.mp3"},{"title":"Chapter 3 Part 2","source":"https://archive.org/download/heart_of_darkness/heart_of_darkness_3b_conrad.mp3"}]},{"title":"Las Fábulas de Esopo, vol. 01","author":"Townsend, George Fyler; tr.

Little Women is the classic story of the March family, which consists of Mr. and Mrs. March and their four girls--practical, yet fashion conscious, Meg, who longs for the nice things they used to have. Rambunctious, book worm, Jo, who wants to become a writer and wishes she were born a boy. Shy and quiet, home-loving Beth, who loves to play the piano and play with her kitties. Finally, the youngest, artistic Amy, who longs for an aristocratic nose!The story takes place during the American Civil War, and begins with Mr. March away from home as a chaplain to the Union army, while his wife and daughters remain at home to work and wait for his safe return.  This book follows their joys and sorrows and scrapes along the path to the girl's becoming grown up \"little women\". Many of the scrapes they get into include Laurie--their harum scarum next door neighbor, who becomes their adopted brother. The two families, the March's and the Laurence's strike up a lasting friendship, despite their differences in material possessions.

Die hier vorliegenden Versionen entsprechen aber stärker den originalen, teils drastischen Fassungen.(Zusammenfassung von Rainer)For further information, including links to online text, reader

G. Wells","description":"Librivox recording of The War of the Worlds, by H. G. Wells.\n\nFor more information on our readers, see our catalog page: http://librivox.org/the-war-of-the-worlds-by-h-g-wells-group/\n\nH. G. Wells wrote The War of the Worlds in 1898, when there was much speculation about life on the planet Mars. The book is considered to be one of the first science fiction novels.  In the story, an English gentleman narrates the events of a violent and fast paced Martian invasion.The frightening images of people fleeing from gigantic tripod machines and the prospect of life under Martial rule have served as a bottomless well of inspiration for popular culture.  The novel has served as a template for many derivative or inspired works, including comics, countless books, a tv series, several films, a bestselling musical, and the famous Orson Wells broadcast. Overall, The War of the Worlds has become an early milestone in and inspiration for the invasion genre.The novel demonstrates Wells' typical pessimistic outlook on human nature and offers a good deal of critisism on society and people's ignorance and vanity. The War of the Worlds can be read as an indictment of European colonial actions around the globe at that time - with which the injustice of the Martian invasion can be compared.  Wells has since been credited with predicting quite a number of technologies, such as laser-like rays, industrial robot-like machines, and chemical-warfare.(Summary by Stephan Möbius and Annie Coleman)\n\nM4B audio book\n\nFor more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit librivox.org\n","cover":"https://ia800707.us.archive.org/7/items/war_of_the_worlds_librivox/war_worlds_group_1109.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2006-05-03 22:59:07","Boxid":"OL100020214","Identifier":"war_of_the_worlds_librivox","Ocr":"ABBYY FineReader 9.0","Ppi":"600","Runtime":"6:43:20","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2006          ","audios":[{"title":"The War of the Worlds -

Collodi","description":"A Librivox recording of Le avventure di Pinocchio by C. Collodi.Read in Italian by Simona.Le avventure di Pinocchio. Storia di un burattino è il titolo del romanzo ottocentesco che ha come protagonista un notissimo personaggio di finzione, appunto Pinocchio, burattino di legno al centro di celeberrime avventure. Si tratta di un classico della cosiddetta letteratura per ragazzi e fu scritto nel 1881 da Collodi (pseudonimo dello scrittore Carlo Lorenzini).Il personaggio di Pinocchio - burattino umanizzato nella tendenza a nascondersi dietro facili menzogne e a cui cresce il naso in rapporto ad ogni bugia che dice - è stato fatto proprio con il tempo anche dal mondo del cinema e da quello dei fumetti. Sulla sua figura sono stati inoltre realizzati album musicali e allestimenti teatrali in forma di musical.Nelle intenzioni di Collodi pare non vi fosse quella di creare un racconto per l’infanzia: nella prima versione, infatti, il burattino moriva, impiccato a causa dei suoi innumerevoli errori. Solo nelle versioni successive, pubblicate a puntate su un quotidiano (il Giornale per bambini), la storia venne modificata con il classico finale che oggi si conosce, con il burattino che assume le fattezze di un ragazzo in carne ed ossa.(Summary from Wikipedia)For further information, including links to M4B audio book, online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if

A modern and honest novel of chance and choice, faith and infidelities, this dark story asks what is free will and what is fate? What is the true nature of nature, and how do we fit together? Can we fit together?A tragedy set in the barren land of Edgon Heath. Our heroine, Eustacia, is proud, passionate, cruel, fickle, avaricious, and desperate. She burns every life she touches, never able to find the mad love and exotic world she dreams of. Our supposed hero, Clym, is modest, steady, plain, moral, and dutiful. He is satisfied returning from Paris to the simple comfort of home.When they come together, the Heath will come apart.Originally released as five books, in classic tragic form, a sixth, tacking on a \"happy ending,\" was added by editor and public pressure.

Schoolcraft and retold by William Trowbridge Larned\n\nRead by Chip\n\nWith no written language, Native Americans living in the Lake Superior region passed their cultural identity down through the generations by way of stories. Far more than mere tales to amuse children, they passed along the collective wisdom of the tribes. In the 1830s, government Indian Agent and ethnologist Henry R Schoolcraft learned the language of these people and went out to collect and preserve their stories before the tribes disappeared under the westward rush of American civilization. Though these stories were recast as children's fairy tales in the 1920s, they contain much of the old wisdom of a culture which has largely disappeared.

Read by Mark F. Smith.A story of castaways, similar to Robinson Crusoe and The Swiss Family Robinson, this book details the escape from Civil War-era Richmond, Virginia, of five Northern men who dared to go aloft in a balloon in the midst of a hurricane. Deposited on a lonely island in the Pacific, they make do with Yankee ingenuity where Chance has left them nothing. Only later do they find they have a hidden benefactor: Captain Nemo, of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, who resides, alone, secretly on the island. In time, the tiny colony becomes so prosperous that it is able to rescue another castaway from an island a hundred miles away. But all their work will come to naught - their island's volcano is about to awake!(Summary by Mark)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.For more free audio books, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit LibriVox.org.Download M4B Part 1 (197MB)Download M4B Part 2 (191MB)Download M4B Part 3 (186MB)\n","cover":"https://ia802701.us.archive.org/29/items/mysterious_island_ms_librivox/mysterious_island.jpg?cnt=0","Addeddate":"2007-05-10 22:52:26","Boxid":"OL100020303","Identifier":"mysterious_island_ms_librivox","Runtime":"21:58:03","Source":"\n              Librivox recording of a public-domain text          ","Tapedby":"\n              LibriVox          ","Year":"\n              2007          ","audios":[{"title":"1-01 The Storm of 1865.

Jahrhunderts begannen die Brüder Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm, traditionelle, bisher vor allem mündlich weitergegebene Erzählungen zusammenzutragen. Diese Sammlung ist als die Märchen der Gebrüder Grimm weltbekannt geworden und umfaßt so berühmte Geschichten wie Rapunzel, Hänsel und Gretel, Rumpelstilzchen, Rotkäppchen und viele andere. Diese Märchen wurden später stark editiert und 'beschönt'. Die hier vorliegenden Versionen entsprechen aber stärker den originalen, teils drastischen Fassungen.(Zusammenfassung von Rainer)For more free audiobooks, or to become a volunteer reader, please visit

Three Musketeers","author":"Alexandre Dumas","description":"Librivox recording of The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. Read by LibriVox Volunteers. The Three Musketeers (Les Trois Mousquetaires) is a novel by Alexandre Dumas, père. It recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan after he leaves home to become a musketeer. D'Artagnan is not one of the musketeers of the title; those are his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis -- inseparable friends who live by the motto, \"One for all, and all for one\".The Three Musketeers was first published in serial form in the magazine Le Siècle between March and July 1844. Dumas claimed it was based on manuscripts he had discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale. It was later proven that Dumas had based his work on the book Mémoires de Monsieur D'Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la première compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi (Memoirs of Mister D'Artagnan, Lieutenant Captain of the first company of the King's Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700). Dumas' version of the story covers the adventures of D'Artagnan and his friends from 1625 to 1628, as they are involved in intrigues involving the weak King Louis XIII of France, his powerful and cunning advisor Cardinal Richelieu, the beautiful Queen Anne of Austria, her English lover, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and the Siege of La Rochelle. Adding to the intrigue are the mysterious Milady de Winter, and Richelieu's right-hand man, the Comte de Rochefort.

Over the centuries, the novel has been repeatedly banned by authorities, assuring its preeminent role in the history of the ongoing struggle against censorship of free expression.Until Fanny Hill, previous heroines had conducted their amorous liaisons \"off-stage.\" Any erotic misadventures were described euphemistically. As women who had gone astray, they always repented, which made even their most outrageous dalliances somehow suitable for a moralistic readership. The protagonist of Fanny Hill, however, never repented a single moment of her sexual exploits ... quite the contrary! And with Fanny, the devil is in the details, realistically described.

A children's classic!Robin Hood is the archetypal English folk hero; a courteous, pious and swashbuckling outlaw of the mediæval era who, in modern versions of the legend, is famous for robbing the rich to feed the poor and fighting against injustice and tyranny. He operates with his \"seven score\" (140 strong) group of fellow outlawed yeomen – named the Merry Men. He and his band are usually associated with Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. The Victorian era generated its own distinct versions of Robin Hood. The traditional tales were often adapted for children, most notably in Howard Pyle's Merry Adventures of Robin Hood. These versions firmly stamp Robin as a staunch philanthropist, a man who takes from the rich to give to the poor.

When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferrars, a match that seems much more suitable. All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways. Since this is an Austen novel and a romance, be assured that all comes right in the end.(Summary by Michelle Crandall)For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS
